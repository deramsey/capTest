1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,029
So this is kind of a review. We've talked about interpersonal relationships.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,709
We talk about interpersonal communication already. But just a review.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:20,260
If you can remember our first lecture, maybe second early on in this semester, I put this on the board.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,570
Right. So.

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,540
This was personal, which is also in the notes on the projector.

6
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:42,560
I'll of that too. And this was highly personal and always includes disclosure of student loans.

7
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:51,770
And so. We look at interpersonal relationships and communication.

8
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:59,570
Remember, it can be impersonal in PR as in AL.

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,190
Or it can be highly personal. Another way of saying impersonal is quantitatively the five.

10
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:21,010
Interpersonal communication, quality numbers. Another way of saying highly personal is qualitative lead upon interpersonal communication quality.

11
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,750
Now, whether it works out on the spectrum.

12
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:37,580
Interpersonal communication will go with people. All right, so I go to the gas station and I get a candy bar.

13
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,190
And. I don't even see them.

14
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,030
And they may not even say anything to me. I thought Candy Bar.

15
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,929
Now they're going to say, is that all? I would say, yes, they ring me up like a bloody stage.

16
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,740
I'm out of there. I go bad. The next day you get candy bar.

17
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,760
I don't spend. An audience.

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,660
This begs. Nor do I care who that person is across from me.

19
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,090
I'm there to give my guarantee and they're there to do their job. I go out to eat the same thing.

20
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,200
I have a different waiter, a waitress, every time we play those roles in this group.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,160
Right. Hello. I've just said I'll be taking your order today.

22
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,270
Well, can I get you started with and then we'll.

23
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,060
You guys, we haven't any dessert. Okay.

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:44,970
Here's your bill. No rush. We're using each other as a means to an end, and certainly that could be a teacher student relationship.

25
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,730
One thing about that, though, is, you know, we would be 2 hours and 30 minutes collectively a week.

26
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,060
So there's going to be opportunity, especially requests like this, where we kind of get to know each other a little bit more.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,310
Right. But still, it's more qualitative in personal.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,660
After this semester, we may or may not see each other in the hall that you may or may not say, hey, hey.

29
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,059
All right. Now your mom and dad. Best friend.

30
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,980
Brother, sister, boyfriend, girlfriend. Highly personal.

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,950
Qualitatively, the bond relations. We don't have these, which is great, everybody.

32
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:35,800
The other special relationships. And then there's this big ball.

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,580
So we're on the spectrum. So.

34
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:50,860
Let's say if you're a lady you might prefer to get your haircut, may not prefer you may get your hair cut or done whatever.

35
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:58,189
Having one present at a certain place, at a certain location, you may, may go to them.

36
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,510
You may start all of them when you were a young child all the way up to now.

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,910
You know, or guys and girls.

38
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,780
We go to get our teeth cleaned and it's kind of awkward.

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,010
So I brought that up yesterday because we're trying to clean our teeth.

40
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,770
Yeah. They're asked to ask questions like, What grade are you in now?

41
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:26,850
And What do you want to do when you graduate and where you want to go to college and all that kind of stuff.

42
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,780
And so that, you know, that's why I put.

43
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,480
These echelons in here because. Those areas can kind of get blurred.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,490
Maybe it's think about this at work.

45
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:51,340
You have people that you work with. It could vary on the spectrum in terms of but still we're communicating.

46
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,480
There's some type of relationship. So therefore.

47
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,810
Whether it's impersonal, quantitatively, qualitatively, highly personal.

48
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,410
There's some sort of interpersonal communication relationships and interpersonal

49
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,510
communication or all the interactions that occur between two people to help start,

50
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,960
build, maintain and sometimes in or redefine a relationship that they would be better off friends.

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,740
I think we should start seeing other people. So it doesn't always have to be a positive connotation.

52
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:38,670
Again, interpersonal relationships defined by a set of expectations people have for each other based on their previous interactions.

53
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:51,720
So. You spend when it's highly personal, you expect that when you test, your friends say, Hey, I need to.

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,350
I just I just I need to. You expect that person may talk or you're I vice versa.

55
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,990
Or so wanted to be running a little bit late. Sure.

56
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,400
So maybe you got a date.

57
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,810
Expect that person to call or to ask how? Well, we were a little bit late.

58
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:19,220
Oh, sorry about that. Sorry. I didn't know I was going to have these things that I had to do.

59
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,230
And then one thing led to another by. Those are expectations we have.

60
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:36,230
We are never sent home in a restaurant and had a waiter or a waitress come up and just stand there and stare at me everywhere you go.

61
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:43,890
It'd be really weird, even if it was like you're first lady doing your job.

62
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,840
I mean, it'd be really like, we know some of that interaction.

63
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:54,470
There's a history there that takes place in even interpersonal communication,

64
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,080
inspired by certain expectations two people have for each other based on the previous interactions.

65
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,440
Right. And, you know, you should, like my colleague that works beside me with this is like I kind of know.

66
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,599
I know she had a son named Ryan. I know he plays baseball and he's the same age as Cam.

67
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,839
I think I've talked about this before, so I'm always asked.

68
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,380
And however, I knew a good baseball. Then she's going to ask how Cam's doing.

69
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,220
And so we remember our previous interactions and the history of those conversations.

70
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,089
So it's not awkward for me to say, Hey, how's Rod or that?

71
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,440
Could you imagine if I didn't know? She didn't tell me that information.

72
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,840
And then I was like, Hey, how's Rod? She'd be freaked out. Should be all right.

73
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,060
So number three is healthy relationship. This is straight forward.

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,420
All these are with the healthy relationship is is a relationship of which the interactions are satisfied all those involved.

75
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,300
Okay. Satisfying all this involved.

76
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:10,070
I mean, the opposite of that you're not saying on here, but when you can imagine it, what it'd be a toxic relationship.

77
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,860
So it would be noxious. It would be, you know,

78
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,760
you ever had a quote unquote friend or a person who's always like finding a way

79
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,330
to disagree with you or or to take shots at your little material aggressions or,

80
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,440
you know, passive aggressiveness and just flat out there be bullying.

81
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,860
Don't be taught that. Be a passive voice. That would be a healthy relationship.

82
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,770
Be unhealthy. All right. Now we will talk about the types of friendships.

83
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,890
There's three we're really going to focus and look at.

84
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,089
The first one is acquaintances. All right.

85
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,470
Raise your hand if you'll be honest. You've never heard of this word before.

86
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,080
No shame. And you're gay. Okay, that would raise your hand.

87
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,150
All right. So that's a good week for our rock n roll.

88
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:10,740
I think if I were to put this in the two words to me of acquaintance, acquaintance, it would be a weak friendship.

89
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,970
And that's kind of how they last, like a friendship.

90
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,480
This should be like, Hey, do you know such a such annual?

91
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,259
You'll be like, Oh, yeah, I know them. But all you really know is maybe their name, what they look like, what they do.

92
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,740
And you don't really know anything more than that. They?

93
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:41,500
So people we know by name and talked to or talked with when opportunity arises, but with whom our interactions are largely.

94
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,640
Here's that word again. Impersonal, which means distant.

95
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:56,720
Is this distant. You know, there's plenty of examples of this, but the one I'll use is.

96
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,210
So I used to teach. Or I'm sorry. My office used to be in the parish we're building.

97
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,810
So obviously this right here is the brand building. Mobile office used to be in parks and then for whatever reason, I don't know why,

98
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,990
but after a year of being in parks, they moved me to that hut to another building.

99
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,569
But when I was initially and partially it was about first year there full time.

100
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,160
That was 2070. That's right.

101
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:33,330
So we right here. And so I was new and shy, reserved and just sort of.

102
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:48,919
Kind of getting used to being there. So I didn't talk a lot to my coworkers, but the people in that hall said include this nicely.

103
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,140
Mr. CHADWICK Mr. Asterisk was. Wilkinson the seal.

104
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,559
So these people would be on my hall.

105
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:09,440
And so it would be. Normal prefer that when I walk down that hall and I had to walk by their offices to meet,

106
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,580
especially their doors open, just kind of way of say how you know this nice little.

107
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,980
Right. And maybe I'll talk to them a little bit.

108
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,520
And. And maybe. Talk about surface level things.

109
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,970
Right. So they might ask me, there's the lines. So how are you enjoying it here so far?

110
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,830
Or is this your first full time teaching job? Where were you an edge before?

111
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,150
How long were you in that job for? What do you teach?

112
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,450
So just like little things that kind of open up the door to try to get to know someone.

113
00:11:52,900 --> 00:12:02,610
But they're surface level things, right? We don't necessarily we I never got into necessarily marital status and children.

114
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,680
A number of children or lack thereof or.

115
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,080
You know. Personal life. Things that involve self disclosure is very surface level stuff.

116
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,790
Okay. So you ask me, how do you know this nicely?

117
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,290
I would say, well, yeah, she teaches here.

118
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,070
But she would be an appointed.

119
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,610
So it's like a friendship. I know her and I knew.

120
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,330
Or I used to work on that whole. But I don't know where that will.

121
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,350
I can't write you a dissertation about her and that kind of thing.

122
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:54,050
Now people in my department, you kind of have to interact with more there.

123
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,320
So it's the same thing. It's the same thing with people at your school, right?

124
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:05,820
Like there's people at your school that you know, oh, they know their face, you know their name, but you don't know.

125
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:15,230
A lot more than that, you know. So it's kind of like maybe a good example of, I know you get this, but if your mom.

126
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:25,830
If friends with another model. And then she introduces you and says, Oh, now who's your son again?

127
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,320
Then they go, Larry. Then he goes to leaving early, too, doesn't he?

128
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,850
Yeah. And then they'll turn to you and say, hey, you know, Larry.

129
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,720
And they get, you know, Larry, but.

130
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,340
You don't know. Right. So you can say, yeah, I know, Larry, you know, acquaintance.

131
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,020
I'll wait for mention, you know, so you'll really know.

132
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,990
And we'll also again, we use this word a couple of times, but in personal communication, this interchangeable,

133
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:08,890
polite chit chat involving no or very little personal disclosure, think about what personal disclosure is.

134
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:17,790
Usually what I think of personal disclosure I'm thinking of. Information that is private that you don't necessarily want everybody else.

135
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:26,780
One. Marital status could be sexual preference, could be religious ideology, could be political ideology.

136
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,230
And I guess some people will care. I mean, might not be the case.

137
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,510
I'll just give you an example. So in personal communication.

138
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,750
It's interchangeable, polite chit chat involving low or very little.

139
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,360
Impersonal or quiet, very little personal seclusion.

140
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,740
The weather outside is fantastic. Is it not in the sun?

141
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:57,260
Real quick and just awful attention. The only word you ever have place outside.

142
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,970
Now. They don't let you do that. I didn't know I would.

143
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,620
I've done that for Ghanaweb. I would do it in it.

144
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,310
But to be fair, it was like a smaller class. There might be too many of us to do that.

145
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,180
But anyway, back on topic. The weather's really nice and it is.

146
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,050
In fact, I'm not. Let's say we're strangers and we're just meeting, I must say.

147
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,549
Yeah, it is nice outside.

148
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:36,459
In fact, right before class I just went out there to the amphitheater and I just sat there and listened to music as it was called.

149
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,660
My and I just wanted to. Soak in the sun.

150
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,540
I might say that is if I offended by that, it might be easy in 2023.

151
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,820
So yeah, well, they were getting canceled because of what I just said.

152
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,750
All right. I think we're okay with that.

153
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,110
So impersonal communication is is very surface level non-controversial.

154
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,640
This is not it works of communication.

155
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:17,350
It is not Republican or Democrat. Are you, Christian?

156
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:26,580
What's your religion? Now you're probably thinking my business will do this, but we don't.

157
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,000
That's way too. That's not impersonal chit chat.

158
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,070
That is not impersonal at all, you know?

159
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,310
So you can always tell and maybe want to be wrong.

160
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,120
Wealthy people over people. But it's always uncomfortable to me.

161
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:49,460
When it gets to that whole level of politics and gas prices and who to blame for that?

162
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:56,200
There's been you know, it's just negative vibes in general.

163
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,670
So this is this is not impersonal.

164
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,450
Communication is is not have you ever been divorced before?

165
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,460
What's your sexual preference? How many kids do you have?

166
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:17,640
How many? It's boyfriend, girlfriend. You know, like, that's not impersonal communication.

167
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,510
Okay? Yes, this is very impersonal communication.

168
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,930
What? They are left out. I know you get it. An innocent compliment.

169
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,180
They are like, you're sure she you get a haircut?

170
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,720
Looks good. That's impersonal communication.

171
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,670
All right. I'm scrolling down. It sits now scrolling down real.

172
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,280
Y'all got somebody taking all of this Oriental. So business.

173
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:55,820
All right. So we face the process of attempting to maintain a positive self-image in relational situation.

174
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,229
Now I have to look at this in a couple of different ways. One,

175
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:08,540
I always think of this always thinking as someone that's trying to save themselves from being embarrassed or seeing someone else from being in their.

176
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,200
You know, our culture is different now more than ever before.

177
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,080
I think it's okay to be older and single, but. But still, there might be a little bit of.

178
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,120
Turn your nose up or not seen as desirable, I guess.

179
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:38,480
And so by somehow, you know, it comes out, you know, that I'm not married or abseil or whatever, you know, I might turn it around.

180
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,000
The person said, Well, you're just you're better off that way. Or good for you, you know?

181
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,530
And that's kind of a way of saving face, life saving and embarrassment or gay marriage, is it for everybody?

182
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,969
Yeah. But so that's one context, one way to look at this.

183
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,260
But really, what this is talking about here, the process of making a positive, self intended relational situation.

184
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:09,620
I think of it as think about how we go back to the idea of playing a spirit or a role.

185
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,380
The idea of. Okay.

186
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:25,410
When you're walking. Let's say you're walking down the hall or anywhere out in public and someone looks at you,

187
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,420
they smile, you smile, and then you might even say, How you doing?

188
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:36,740
Good. How are you? I would love to know the number the average person.

189
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,620
How many times in a lifetime that's.

190
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,600
Said, Hey, how are you? Good. You? Okay.

191
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,860
No one would say unless you're a close friend.

192
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,490
No one's going to say, Oh, my gosh. Horrible.

193
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:03,040
Let me tell you about it. Could you imagine somebody doing that, especially, you know, you would be a weirdo.

194
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,410
You would think, I don't care. Tom, what is going on here?

195
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,930
What have I got myself into? So our whole thing will go out into the world is.

196
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,690
I'm not weird. I'm cool. No, I'm not weird.

197
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:23,140
I'm cool unless you're just being sarcastic and tongue in cheek.

198
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,300
We told people that they were weird. We want them to accept us in the likeness.

199
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,030
So here's a fantastic example.

200
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,890
Let's pretend that you are faculty. Staff?

201
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,549
You work here, then? Si, si, si. And this.

202
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,380
This happens every year at the first day of the.

203
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:54,230
Of the semester. But with the beginning of the year in August.

204
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,780
Got her saying, well, we'll see who's the vice president.

205
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:05,710
We'll say, okay, so we got some new people here. We're good at college and we're excited to have them.

206
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:13,200
If you would, if you'll stand out when I call your name and just introduce yourself to everybody,

207
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:18,020
maybe give a couple of lines about whatever you want to say.

208
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:25,110
So just addresses the teaching call for this semester, and then I would stand up.

209
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,350
Hey, guys, I'm Jesse Jackson, and I'm teaching communications here at the college.

210
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,340
I'm really excited about and I really enjoy teaching communications.

211
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,840
And this is just happy to be here.

212
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,270
Thank you. Okay. Was that weird and normal?

213
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:51,750
No. If I had got up there and I did and I crossed my arms and I love story now and I was like, oh, my gosh, I just.

214
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:01,050
It is just a wildcard weird race.

215
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,300
That would be funny. You're being sarcastic and you're being serious about it and would be.

216
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,770
Would you want to hang out with that guy? Probably not.

217
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:18,320
I been looking at her slab like, whatever happens here, I've got to stay away from him.

218
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,739
This guy's trouble is trouble.

219
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:31,110
He is weird. He's not alone. So Saving Face is a process of attempting to maintain a positive self-image in relational situation.

220
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,890
All right. You're meeting someone's parents for the first time.

221
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,590
That is the handshake. Smile. Hey, how are you?

222
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,750
Nice to meet you. Okay.

223
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,450
Friends. So I thought we were really have three types of friends.

224
00:22:53,050 --> 00:23:00,670
So the second tier friends or people with whom we have voluntarily negotiated more personal relationships.

225
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:14,050
Now to me. And I think what I gather here is that there is a difference between friends and best friends,

226
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:20,110
or, as they call it here, intimate friends, best friends or intimates.

227
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,160
And I'll give you example. So Saturday night, I got together with a couple of my friends.

228
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:37,850
And we went to a place called the Blind Horse Saloon is a bar in Greenville, South Carolina, to watch Chris Cagle, an old country singer.

229
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,239
Okay. Now, one of my friends is there in general, and we've been friends for a little time.

230
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,140
But I got to be honest, the last time we hung out was one a year ago.

231
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:55,330
I mean, it's been a while. We just test. While the three feel good.

232
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:07,729
We've been friends for 30 years. There's a picture of us together, like when we were ten years old and three kids about to be 40.

233
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:20,110
Angela. And sidenote sorry, I don't want to break your heart, but you don't tend to my opinion to stay friends with people.

234
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,210
You will. The high school will. I'll note this news, too.

235
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:33,790
But here's an exception. We stayed friends for for three years, and it's kind of we've been closer at times than others.

236
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,030
Like we we spend every weekend. Used to spend a lot of weekends together.

237
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,949
And then, you know, he's engaged now and she has a son.

238
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:57,730
And so we we're not it might have been two years and so we test, but it's kind of it's not since soul it's not like we're tested even.

239
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,610
Every one. Maybe. I mean, it's just. Kevin hit or miss.

240
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,190
So it's funny because we went to this concert. We went to see the same singer 20 years ago.

241
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:17,460
It's culture. And so I use that to say that they're not my best friends.

242
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,260
Something happened or they needed me, or there's a wedding.

243
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,260
I'll be there dancing with Ted.

244
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:30,760
But we're not best friends. Just. Just friends, okay?

245
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:38,670
Okay. They're not acquaintances. I certainly know they're more than on the surface level, for sure.

246
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,610
They're not acquaintances. But they're not best friends.

247
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,680
For me, a best friend would be an intimate.

248
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:55,130
Now we have to kind of get out of the mindset that, you know, you think they're being intimate.

249
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,730
There's always a sexual connotation that's associated with that.

250
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,639
We have to get out of that mindset because Intimate says best, very intimate as a whisper.

251
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,750
And that's really what an intimate is, an essential role so that we're not we're not romantic relationships.

252
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,610
Intimate says they're really a best friend.

253
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:22,280
So intimacy doesn't always have to equate to a sexual relationship.

254
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:30,820
So these are people with whom we share a high degree of interdependence, commitment, disclosure, understanding, affection and trust.

255
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:35,920
So remember what into dependance means into dependance.

256
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,740
Think of it like the opposite of independence. Two separate in turn means one to face the other.

257
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,459
So when this person is hurting you, her, when something cool is happening in there,

258
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:55,780
why you're so static and happy that something cool is happening in another person's life.

259
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,930
It's almost like you got a pay raise or you got the job or you got the award.

260
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,860
So what happens? The person affects you.

261
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,720
Interdependence. There's commitment. There's disclosure.

262
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,410
So here we're talking about politics. We're talking about religion.

263
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,570
Maybe we're going to talk about past relationships. Current relationships.

264
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:28,860
The good, the bad and the ugly. We're going to understand each other.

265
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,370
There's going to be a passion. There's going to be trust.

266
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,330
And so, hey, this is a new record. I will not give it up for 45 minutes.

267
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,430
I have not said it, but here you go. Are you ready, Mr. Pittman?

268
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:55,220
Whatever it is, it is. One of my best friends died.

269
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,280
I don't want to use the word curse again.

270
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,540
Is that what? Yeah. But look, Mr. Pyramid and I are instantly.

271
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,530
He is my best friend. And I have my friends.

272
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,740
And we're tall. I'd say we're. We're best friends. I'll talk to him about once a week.

273
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:26,020
We talk football. That's about every Monday after after 230, 4:00 or 345 class.

274
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:32,150
We were talking about football. Yesterday we called in and I think it was last day.

275
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:43,280
So I'd say he went in detail about how it wasn't going well with his fiancee and all that and some kind of stuff.

276
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,940
I mean, we're going to make it in 20 years and hopefully it turns out to be away.

277
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,420
So. Mr. Pittman.

278
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,159
Okay, when I joke, this is our sarcasm.

279
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,930
Okay. But, you know, I think I totally nominated him last year for Factory of the Year.

280
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:11,430
And I don't know him this year and last year. I'm being sarcastic, but we got screwed as well, let's say.

281
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:16,470
And he's like, we, I'm like, Yeah, wait, so I'm a part of this thing.

282
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:23,740
And I said this. I will take matters into my own hand if I have to.

283
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,710
We're not losing this. Kidding.

284
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:37,830
All right. In all seriousness, when he feels bad or he's down, you know, then I feel bad that he feels bad.

285
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,990
It was something cool happens.

286
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:48,209
Like, seriously, I will be I will be as happy as him if he wins on the air, because there's going to be money tied to it.

287
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,670
So, you know, I'll be really happy because I'll be honest.

288
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,250
Like if I won or something like that, it would be cool. But he will.

289
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,690
I don't think anybody would be more honored to win.

290
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:10,880
So like for him to win, it never be like. I don't know.

291
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:19,360
I mean. The money is important to him, but just that recognition and that mindset as well.

292
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,460
I recognize that my peers as the factory of the year.

293
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:37,180
So there's interdependence there. When you got into a he's okay, but a cop hit him a couple of weeks ago, you know, and so I was the course.

294
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,250
I was like, Are you okay?

295
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,640
Was everybody okay? And and that kind of thing.

296
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:50,649
And then, of course, I laughed at him because I mean, as a cop, how do you hear about being a little out there?

297
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:57,680
But it wasn't his fault. And so. There's commitment, there's disclosure.

298
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:05,120
Mr. Pittman knows where I stand for political reasons.

299
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,210
And we've talked about, you know, we both share Christian faith.

300
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:20,960
So we disclose that. So there's understanding, even though it's hard to understand why he is so nerdy.

301
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:31,670
I have understood about him and I'm sure he has a hard time understanding why I'm so nonchalant and laid back.

302
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,930
Is it a good balance? Good yin and yang. That can be a little too laid back.

303
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,900
And he can't be a little too strong. I don't know about fashion.

304
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,600
I. I get my my idea of a fashion is sarcasm.

305
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:54,000
So I think until I've told Joel the the thing I did a couple of weeks ago when he was freaked

306
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,480
out about having to have his papers graded and he didn't come out of office like he does daily.

307
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,080
And I tested, I said, Hey, are you okay? And he tested.

308
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:10,970
Papers degrade stress and money tight.

309
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,080
E and I wrote that well-rested ridge.

310
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,970
It was very nearly test of that.

311
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,650
I was just and it's going to be okay. But I do that.

312
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,430
Just. I love you so. Oh.

313
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:36,020
Straight legs. I love saying stuff just to get kind of a reaction out of.

314
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:43,430
And sometimes I can be so serious and he doesn't know if I'm joking or not is my favorite thing.

315
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:51,620
Then of course, there's trust. I mean, I know I can tell him things and he can tell me things, and it's not really that room,

316
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,890
especially what we're talking about, all of the all in detail.

317
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,629
I'll carry out his way. And, you know, I did acid the acid there.

318
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,490
I said, I want to know every single thing.

319
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:12,770
You know, I got to look out for its true ocean ocean and I don't do that but there is trust says that's all right so.

320
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,690
It is our last year's romantic relationship.

321
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:24,670
So this is an intimate relationship in which the partners acknowledge their sexual attraction.

322
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,810
I think that's pretty straightforward. So we've got acquaintances.

323
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:34,310
We have brains, we have intimacy, and then there's romantic relationships.

324
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,860
The. Oh.

325
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:49,410
I'll have to joke with Mr. Pittman about that, because when he goes to lunch with his wife, Robin, I'm like, you know, the saying guys before wives.

326
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:59,560
You know what? I'm more important than her. Will Ferrell once again shirtless.

327
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:08,670
I think that's pretty straight forward in terms of what it is, place in confidence and another in a way that almost always involves some risk.

328
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,680
Now, I think it was the Monday, Wednesday class. I don't think it was.

329
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,359
I'm not me, Roh, but it doesn't matter because it's going to be true.

330
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,110
And you all know it's going to be true. And I'm sorry, 20 years from now or two years from now, when you're my age.

331
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,860
20, not 40. For 20 years now, it'll still be true.

332
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:33,650
You have to be careful who you trust and who confided right.

333
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:46,660
Who you self-disclose to. The mistake when you think you had a kid to MIT or even maybe a friend, and maybe that kind of makes the difference.

334
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:54,250
You tell them something in privacy and they run back and they tell someone else and then it comes back to you.

335
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,030
And then the relationship there is fractured.

336
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:10,910
Okay. Especially, you know, this really bad and they can think it or they just use it was, Fulgoni said.

337
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:19,160
In other words, they throw it up in your face that you know, you embarrassed yourself or whatever.

338
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:25,850
So we have to be careful who we trust. But ideally we would like to think that we can trust someone.

339
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:34,670
Maybe, hopefully, hopefully you got someone in your life, probably intimate or a romantic relationship that you had confided in for us.

340
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:40,340
And then I would go around and tell anybody and everybody, and they're certainly not going to tell the person that you're talking about.

341
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,550
Maybe we're not talking about them, but you know what I'm saying? Reciprocity.

342
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:52,909
And this is that reciprocity offsetting, which is how I said it when I was follow your age.

343
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:59,750
Reciprocity, honesty. Greendale Resident Trustee Reciprocity.

344
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:09,500
When you hear when you take the reciprocity, I want you to break it down and think of it in the two words to match, you know, the same definition.

345
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,650
That's how you think of reciprocity means. To message.

346
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:21,630
Is the practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit.

347
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,300
Now, a little back up or for just a second or a few examples of reciprocity.

348
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:38,650
When I was going through your test book. Yesterday, I was kind of skipping alone, seeing how the news related to the sex scandal.

349
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,700
There's something called my. When it comes to arguments.

350
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:55,880
And I found this really interesting. Okay. So, you know, think about maybe, you know, in terms of acquaintances, gosh, Kojima put a number on that.

351
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,520
Now, friends, I would imagine that number gets slower and intimate.

352
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:08,870
I imagine that number gets even smaller in romantic relationships for your sake.

353
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:12,530
And benefit, I hope is real.

354
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,149
But no, I love. In fact. You know what? I'm your dad.

355
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:21,110
Who's your dad? That, Joe, that is coming in.

356
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,210
Are you ready? 0000.

357
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,590
I don't want you dating anybody. Okay. How about that noise?

358
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,260
Not even not even going to prom. Not even going to prom king.

359
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:39,710
Who was it that is in the other class to kill me?

360
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:44,300
She said, I've never heard this before. She said.

361
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:52,940
Six feet for covered and four feet for Jesus.

362
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:59,030
Six feet recovered. Never heard that one for the U.S.

363
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,850
That's good. That's good for por for Jesus.

364
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,160
So when you're dancing is going to be available in the prime policy this.

365
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,690
I want to be there to help out that. Okay. I'm not.

366
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,940
I'm not going to be there. All right. All right. Back home, thought.

367
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,700
It was getting too serious. And I want to make sure you all are paying attention. We pray.

368
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,610
Go ahead, then. Be intimate. And according to our test book,

369
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:44,330
the percentage of Americans who identify having just one intimate relationship beyond family members declined from 80% in 1985 to just 57% in 2006.

370
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:53,120
Today, most Americans report having no more than two intimate parties, including family members, and that as of 2011.

371
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,010
So we went from 1985. We were 80%.

372
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,840
And now two 657 and 1211.

373
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,740
Most of us, the poor, have a one or two, like I said, sharp.

374
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:18,010
And Pete or Mr. Bittman, you know, I mean, those are probably my main two best friends.

375
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,680
Okay. So and I think it might be different when you're younger, because when you're in this kind of social environment,

376
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:28,710
chances are you're going to probably have more acquaintances, friends and intimate.

377
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:35,259
Now, obviously, you get a massive amount of fear if you want to join in and this is being recorded.

378
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:41,260
But or we could talk about this another day. My thoughts as to why this is the case.

379
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,410
Let's think about what the world looked like in 1985.

380
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,140
There was no Internet. You had TV?

381
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:58,570
Well, pretty much. You had four channels or 730 and 41.

382
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:02,650
And there used to be a time and I forgot about this. This is a little bit before my time.

383
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:14,830
I'm not so sure if in 1985, after 11:00, when you turn the TV over, you saw nothing, but you saw like three circles and just nothing.

384
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:25,480
And then at 7 a.m., the TV is back all. And of course, later and maybe late eighties, early nineties, cable TV became more popular.

385
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,940
And then in the late nineties Internet and then 2000, 2009.

386
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,740
Not only do we have laptop, but now every single one of us has.

387
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,580
The whole. And we're not using the bulb at all.

388
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:52,070
We're using the follow the test. So the face to face communication is less and less, more distant.

389
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,030
And we're what? I mean, social media.

390
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:02,140
Amazon. Listen to music, watch TV.

391
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,980
Anything and everything that we could do. Like you, literally.

392
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,060
You can go to your whole world with. With the phone.

393
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:13,390
I mean, you really can. You really can.

394
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:22,420
I'm not knocking it at all, because sometimes I think to myself, what I can't imagine is, first off, it's got to be a great device if you're a parent.

395
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,530
Like when I was a parent or when I was there, when I was a kid,

396
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:35,310
I had like Little Power Rangers or Ninja Turtles toys that I'd use my imagination with in the back of the car.

397
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,840
And now you've got a kid that will stop talking or what?

398
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,090
You go and get on there and I can play games and all that stuff.

399
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:50,739
So I think I'm not knocking it. I'm just kind of telling you why.

400
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,550
I think that number is still from the biggest reason that numbers.

401
00:41:54,700 --> 00:42:02,020
We went from 80% to now just 57 versus what you just have.

402
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,050
This is like saying, go to your old world. I mean, you can go on YouTube.

403
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:16,459
You can you can very specific niche things all with that device.

404
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,370
And maybe there's other reasons, too. I mean, I don't know.

405
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:31,310
I mean, you can get into the thought of it all, especially it gives you that adrenaline rush of you become a visually stimulating.

406
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,800
And I'm all over y'all. But sometimes I have friends and it's like I already know what they're going to say.

407
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:43,590
And it's kind of boring when not in this in and.

408
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,880
You know, it's just kind of years old, so I might be wrong on that,

409
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,820
but that's kind of what the percentage that's from 1857, that's pretty significant.

410
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,220
Additionally, according to a recent University of Oxford study,

411
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:12,080
even though we may have hundreds of hundreds of Facebook friends, the number of truly close friends is still very small.

412
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:20,860
The authors believe this dramatic decline is particularly troubling given that intimate

413
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:26,290
relationships are less and more predictor of life satisfaction and emotional well-being.

414
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,990
Yeah. The Facebook, they are no longer able to build Facebook.

415
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:36,680
And that's not a bad thing. I wouldn't. I'm not saying I'm not discouraging that.

416
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,450
I'm not saying, oh, my God, it's the dirtiest thing I've read or think after this.

417
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,310
For 20 years of it's like.

418
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:52,600
The problem that I was just talking about with people and that interaction is it is kind of boring, not we kind of know what to expect.

419
00:43:53,260 --> 00:44:00,000
But piggybacking off that, there's so many people and there's people on my Facebook account and they are how do I know who?

420
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:11,010
I really don't know. Sometimes I would hit that set request because I went to high school with them, so I knew it.

421
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:19,169
That or, you know, I talk about true, true college. And so I would just tell someone a profile picture that they looked like they had it so obvious.

422
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:27,090
Just set that request. But there's so many people like I don't know how I know them.

423
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,870
So and none of them are are true friendships.

424
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,760
They're definitely acquaintances.

425
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:47,850
I just give you real I love somebody says like or in a story you're giving someone permission to stop here so you can stop in one environment.

426
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,720
Okay, so reciprocity. The practice of exchange for mutual better reciprocity.

427
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:04,740
I don't know about you, but any time somebody gives me a compliment, I feel like I have to say something about the other person to say something.

428
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,400
That's that. And that's reciprocity. So someone say, Hey, is that a new haircut?

429
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:18,290
And you're like, Yeah. And then it's going to be mutually impossible for you to compliment you or you know.

430
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:27,390
We can also do this with this is kind of weird and tongue in cheek, but my birthday was like a month ago.

431
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,440
So again, I'm going on the Facebook to stall people.

432
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,000
I guess that's the whole I'm not person stuff. I'm not doing that.

433
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:42,840
So anyway, I get all these on my birthday. I get all these messages, all these.

434
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:48,470
Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. And I feel bad when it happens.

435
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,230
The reason I feel bad is because I never tell anyone over Facebook.

436
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:00,350
Happy birthday. I never knew. And so then I had to go in there and Clinton.

437
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:09,400
And then there have been times I've gotten better. But I remember years ago I would feel bad, like, okay, let me go your Facebook page.

438
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:16,899
Something to like. Scroll over to political stuff like any other time.

439
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,320
So something online and so.

440
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,720
Oh. Then it becomes a thing.

441
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,620
And in. That's the idea of reciprocity.

442
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,640
I have to say thank you for all the birthday wishes or that kind of thing.

443
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:43,650
Sometimes it would be a task you have to fill out. You have to write that thank you and that kind of thing.

444
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,880
And look at you. I mean, how it's just all right.

445
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,530
It could be. Here is probably another example, too, that I don't even know what this is.

446
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:10,920
This one's that great, but. When my boss, my last boss, when she was here last semester, I teach public speaking.

447
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,990
Right. And they had to do a demonstration speech, which is a healthy speech.

448
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,550
And in a healthy speech, they also will.

449
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,560
They knew how to make some kind of brownie or cookies or whatever.

450
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:45,060
And so last semester. So when they have these rallies and all those things where I was doing a 9008 to someone that left a brownie and.

451
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,440
And tell their buddies know when they do that.

452
00:47:51,160 --> 00:48:02,640
Obviously, it's kind of a way to suck down. But to be fair, I had a little bit of anxiety and especially the door open,

453
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,190
but they do not, you know, 100 or a higher level greatest cause they give me food.

454
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,870
Now that sun is up. And so.

455
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,640
So at all costs psychologically, does it make a difference?

456
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:30,660
I'm sure it does. What I did is I took that brownie in that code cause my boss was like, right.

457
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,629
She was at that hole actually, like, right there. So I took it a little nervous.

458
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:44,970
And I well, the way I would laugh is that she's very, very, very nice if she calls me, oh, my gosh, you do that thing so much.

459
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:48,390
And then of course, I said, Well, hold up. It was from a student.

460
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:53,700
They were doing demonstration speeches and I was just thinking that you would enjoy it.

461
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:06,200
And so that was that. I guess the reciprocity could work in a nanosecond, but I always think of it as a positive one.

462
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:12,090
Know, I think it devalues in a positive circumstance.

463
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,810
Now, I want to tell you all this because. This is this is big picture.

464
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,360
This is big picture of us. Let's say you go to a job interview.

465
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:28,730
I had someone I did not know this until.

466
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,900
After I teach you the SCC as an adjunct.

467
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:46,020
So this is a true passion of masters. I mean, I've never heard this so general little thing from career services to talk to my class.

468
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:57,960
And she got in the class and she, she tells all this information, the stuff we already knew what most of it is, do's and don'ts.

469
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:10,570
I did. This one was really interesting. Okay. She said that what you want to do at the end of the interview, you won't cut it down.

470
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,479
You probably say something like,

471
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:23,630
would you call it off when you leave the job and you do it down to the dollar $3 general or whatever, and you're going to buy a car.

472
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:35,640
And you're going to address that person to Mr. Whatever in a summary and in detail.

473
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:40,620
But you're going to. Right. Thank you so much for your time.

474
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:50,250
And I truly hope that, well, you sincerely so shortly send an email.

475
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:57,550
Right. She said that she had a student.

476
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:09,040
That literally was all. The reason that they got the job was the cause of that letter.

477
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:16,390
Now, here's what they've got to keep in mind. Everything that we do in an interview matters every single thing.

478
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:22,940
One of the things our team did know was that when you go to India, you don't want to spoil anything.

479
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:30,720
So, you know, a lot of me know all I know in this place.

480
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:39,260
All right. All right. You take a bath. I will tell you that what we're doing is smells good,

481
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:45,730
but we're not going to add pool or we don't we definitely don't want to see the reason that we don't want to

482
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:56,210
see that color to throw on your smell is because it may encounter in a interact if someone has your allergies.

483
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:01,280
And I know it's crazy and it seems like a small detail, but small details matter.

484
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,920
You don't want to interact with that person's allergies, and that has to be decided.

485
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:15,080
Also, this was a different look, too. I did not like the lady's nose earrings.

486
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:22,700
And the reason is because it could be see nonverbal communication as or which means flirtatious.

487
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:30,680
I know you're thinking really, but. And if you're also involved in the medical field and you have longer hair,

488
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:38,209
pull it up because it's a non-verbal way of saying, I'm really not ready to talk.

489
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:41,750
And medical bills. I know at this job I'll have to have my hair pulled out.

490
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:51,739
So now again, just going to give someone a thank you car does not necessarily mean that you're going to get the job.

491
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:57,950
But think about it first. Think about how it's a nice thing that you can do that you don't have to do that,

492
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:03,290
but differentiate yourself just a little bit, especially like in all things,

493
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:14,809
where even the GPA, your skill set, the may, let's say if they're sitting there listening to you are pounding your head against the desk going,

494
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:24,520
I don't know if I'm that person, a person being that you're a member or you see a thank you note for a person and not person

495
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:31,309
who you will likely name because those are all things or even right now list and study hard.

496
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:37,940
That's the most important thing. And work hard, right? But these little things, they have an impact.

497
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:47,810
So that's reciprocity. Reciprocity is the practice of exchanging things with others or mutual benefit.

498
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,610
Scholar Maybe y'all, I have no idea. But let's say hypothetically,

499
00:53:52,910 --> 00:54:02,580
you're giving a student a dollar for copying the notes for you and maybe give it another student as a dollar for making a equivalent for you.

500
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,940
You know, that could be the example of reciprocity or reciprocity.

501
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:13,100
Again, it is to match. Oh, there's another one.

502
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:20,780
There's another like media example that I'll share with you.

503
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:27,830
I think this is really fun. So a show called The Office, of course, and there's an episode I make sure to go another day.

504
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,780
Andy and Dwight are basically out and I see one another.

505
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:44,470
And so in the episode, Andy holds the door for people coming in to work and the wife sees the Dwight comes in and then he has to hold the door,

506
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,680
and Andy brings, like, donuts for everybody.

507
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,690
Well, Dwight, for what? He brings peace for everybody.

508
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,010
And Andy tells Dwight, Here's a Groupon.

509
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:03,850
I thought about you. So Dwight turned around. Oh, here's a group offering this could spark a war.

510
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:07,300
It's this idea, like I was talking earlier with social media,

511
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:14,560
where you feel like you're almost obligated, like you have to match someone else's niceness.

512
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,230
And I am being sarcastic here when I'm about to say I'm being sarcastic.

513
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:25,840
Okay. But I have a coworker and she buys donuts for us.

514
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:29,080
I swear, it's like every Monday. And they're from Eagles.

515
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,559
So the problem with that is what I'm trying to I'm at one of three.

516
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,670
I want to get to 187. That's the way it's supposed to be. So we're talking £6.

517
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:46,470
So where where? You know, that's not I know she's trying to be nice, but then another part of me is like casting it.

518
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:53,310
No, I don't. To do something nice. I got to bring in food or I got to bring an M.A. in.

519
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:58,040
Know. Hey, is Ingles. Sometimes she brings in donuts.

520
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,380
Nice try. That was Krispy Kreme. Well, I have a problem.

521
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,570
Then we're in it for one eye. I want to go for one and three.

522
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:19,080
So 197, Krispy Kreme is it's kind of like for me, if you tell me, hey, Dr. Jackson,

523
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:24,060
I brought you pizza, but you brought me to Dino's or so kind of frozen.

524
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:32,270
That will work. You bring me. The real stuff like piece of perfect.

525
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,680
Okay. So reciprocity is too much reciprocity.

526
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:42,810
And we're going to get.
